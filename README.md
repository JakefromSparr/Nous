# Nous: 
## A Game for Connoisseurs

*A haunted trivia experience—where what you know reveals more than you think.*

**Nous** is a social, experiential game played by a group acting as a single mind. Inspired by *Ouija*, *Barnum psychology*, and *personality tests*, it uses trivia not as a test of knowledge—but as a mirror. Every answer you give tells it something. About you. About your group. About what you’re hiding from yourselves.

Players think they’re playing a clever trivia game.  
But the game is really playing them.

## How It Works

- **Trivia Cards** test knowledge in categories of *Mind*, *Body*, and *Soul*. But each choice is scored in secret, revealing traits and tendencies.
- **Fate Cards** interpret these traits through *Divinations*, *Group Dynamics*, and eerie *Directions*—crafted to feel uncomfortably personal.
- **The Last Deck** delivers final questions, secret awards, and a group reading that feels… too accurate.
