Nous: A Game for Connoisseurs

A haunted trivia experience—where what you know reveals more than you think.

Nous is a social, experiential trivia game blending the uncanny nature of Ouija, the wild unpredictability of Jumanji, and the strategic curiosity of Trivial Pursuit. Designed not just to challenge what you know but how you think, Nous acts as a psychological mirror, uncovering hidden biases and interpretive patterns within players.

You might believe you’re simply answering trivia—but the game is quietly analyzing you.

📖 Project Overview

Nous asks players to confront their assumptions, not their knowledge. Each carefully crafted question is intentionally neutral, yet subtly manipulative, prompting internal debate and surprising revelations. It’s a game about assumptions, interpretations, and the thrill of discovering unexpected truths about yourself and your friends.

🔮 The Nous Experience

Each question in Nous invites players to reveal their cognitive and interpretive biases through:
	•	Typical Answers (+2 pts): Instinctive responses based on cultural or linguistic assumptions.
	•	Revelatory Answers (+1 pt, +1 Thread): Clever interpretations uncovering hidden logic.
	•	Wrong Answers (0 pts, -1 Thread): Plausible traps for the unwary.

The game tracks patterns across three distinct categories:
	•	Mind (Language, Logic)
	•	Body (Practical, Sensory)
	•	Soul (Emotional, Ethical)

Each answer increments a delta on a trait spectrum across three axes ranging from -9 to +9:
	•	X-axis (Logic): Analytical ↔ Innovative
	•	Y-axis (Framing): Conventional ↔ Radical
	•	Z-axis (Epistemic): Mythic ↔ Empirical

These traits are used to “know” the participant—each session is played by a group acting as a single player, similar to Ouija—and unsettle them with Barnum-effect-style readings.

This unique gameplay uncovers surprising truths, asking not, “Are you right?” but rather, “Why did you think that was the only way to be right?”
